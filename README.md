# Deep-Learning-for-Image-Classification
This project has a two-deep learning methods.1) Deep learning using by CNN. 2) Deep learning using Transfer learning using Alexnet. The second method uses two types of image dataset one is of flowers and the other is of roundworms.

You need to have deep learning toolbox installed in your MATLAB first.
You can install the toolbox using the "install package" in MATLAB.
